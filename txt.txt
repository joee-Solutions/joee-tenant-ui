Let's make some modifications.
1. Right now the search on the mainheader only search the organization and we have data in all other pages as well. i suggest we go deeper than just search the organization.
2. in the dashboard: the appointment chart is empty when there's no data let use gray to replace the empty bar, and you know it is appointment for all the organizations and not just one organization. When there is no data for employee the design should show proper and get the message of no employee instead of empty design and message, like the box have a design background, and it is all employee for all the organizations and not just one organization. In the patience let replace the empty bar with gray as well and instead of 0 people it should be 0 patince, and there is %50 below 30 years when the patince is 0, that is not possible, remove the view all in te patience, and it is patience for all organizations and not just one organization. in the organization status let remove deactived organization and add all organzition and make all them to click to there pages
